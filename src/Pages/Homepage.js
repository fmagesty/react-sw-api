        This project is all about working with an API and Json data. It was a
        project developed by the PodCodar community and asked the developer to
        search the starwar ships on the API and show it's information without
        using any library that worked with it. This was a good challenge and
        interesting project. It was made in React. Currently it searches for
        ships but also characters and planets aswell.
